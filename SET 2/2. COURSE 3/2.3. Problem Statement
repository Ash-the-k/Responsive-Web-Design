### Revised Problem Statement

Create a **Nutrition Facts Label** similar to what is commonly found on food packaging. Follow these guidelines:

Use Google Fonts for styling by linking the Open Sans font family (400, 700, 800 weig

1. **Header Section**:
   - Display the title "Nutrition Facts" in bold, centered.
   - Show that there are "8 servings per container."
   - Include "Serving size 2/3 cup (55g)" right below the servings per container.

2. **Calories Info**:
   - Display the calories as "230" on the right side, aligned with the text "Calories" on the left.
   - Above this, include "Amount per serving" in smaller text.

3. **Daily Value Section**:
   - Display various nutritional facts such as:
     - **Total Fat**: 8g (10%)
       - **Saturated Fat**: 1g (5%) indented under Total Fat.
       - **Trans Fat**: 0g further indented.
     - **Cholesterol**: 0mg (0%)
     - **Sodium**: 160mg (7%)
     - **Total Carbohydrate**: 37g (13%)
       - **Dietary Fiber**: 4g indented under Total Carbohydrate.
       - **Total Sugars**: 12g indented.
         - **Includes 10g Added Sugars** further indented (20%).
     - **Protein**: 3g
   - Ensure the daily value percentages (e.g., "10%", "5%") are aligned to the right.

4. **Additional Nutrients**:
   - Display other nutrients such as:
     - **Vitamin D**: 2mcg (10%)
     - **Calcium**: 260mg (20%)
     - **Iron**: 8mg (45%)
     - **Potassium**: 235mg (6%)

5. **Footer Section**:
   - Include a note: "* The % Daily Value (DV) tells you how much a nutrient in a serving of food contributes to a daily diet. 2,000 calories a day is used for general nutrition advice."

6. **Styling**:
   - Use appropriate indentations for nested elements like **Saturated Fat** and **Added Sugars**.
   - Include necessary margins and padding to ensure spacing between sections.
   - Add dividers between key sections.
   - Apply bold styling where needed, especially for nutrient names and daily values.
   - The label should have a clean, minimal design with black text on a white background, and thin borders.

Feel free to incorporate any extra details for spacing, alignment, and other design elements.
