### Problem Statement: Photo Gallery with Flexbox

**Objective:**
Create a photo gallery webpage using HTML and CSS that displays a collection of images in a responsive, flexbox-based layout.

---

**HTML Structure:**
1. Start with the basic HTML5 structure.
2. Set the document's language to English.
3. Ensure the character encoding is set to UTF-8.
4. Include a `meta` tag to make the page responsive on all devices.
5. Set the title of the webpage to "Photo Gallery".
6. Link an external CSS file named `styles.css`.

7. In the body:
   - Create a `header` containing an `h1` element with the text "css flexbox photo gallery".
   - Below the header, create a `div` element with a class of `gallery`.
   - Inside the `gallery` div, add nine `img` elements. Use the following image sources and provide alternative text for each:
     - Image 1: "https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/css-photo-gallery/1.jpg"
     - Image 2: "https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/css-photo-gallery/2.jpg"
     - Image 3: "https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/css-photo-gallery/3.jpg"
     - Image 4: "https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/css-photo-gallery/4.jpg"
     - Image 5: "https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/css-photo-gallery/5.jpg"
     - Image 6: "https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/css-photo-gallery/6.jpg"
     - Image 7: "https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/css-photo-gallery/7.jpg"
     - Image 8: "https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/css-photo-gallery/8.jpg"
     - Image 9: "https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/css-photo-gallery/9.jpg"

**Styling Requirements:**

1. **Global Styles:**
   - Apply `box-sizing: border-box;` to all elements using the universal selector.
   - Remove default margin from the body.
   - Set the `font-family` of the body to sans-serif.
   - Set the background color of the body to `#f5f6f7`.

2. **Header Styling:**
   - Center the text inside the header.
   - Transform the text to uppercase.
   - Apply `padding` of `32px` to the header.
   - Set the background color of the header to `#0a0a23` (dark blue).
   - Change the text color to white (`#fff`).
   - Add a solid border at the bottom of the header that is `4px` thick and has a color of `#fdb347` (yellow).

3. **Gallery Styling:**
   - Use flexbox to arrange the images in a row.
   - Allow the images to wrap onto the next line when necessary.
   - Center the images horizontally within the gallery.
   - Center the images vertically within each row.
   - Maintain a gap of `16px` between the images.
   - Limit the maximum width of the gallery to `1400px`.
   - Center the gallery div on the page.
   - Add `padding` of `20px` on the top and bottom, and `10px` on the left and right.

4. **Image Styling:**
   - Ensure the images are responsive by setting their width to `100%`.
   - Set the maximum width of each image to `350px`.
   - Fix the height of each image at `300px`.
   - Make sure the images cover the entire container without distortion.
   - Round the corners of the images using a `border-radius` of `10px`.

5. **Additional Styling:**
   - Use the `::after` pseudo-element on the `gallery` div to add an invisible block with a width of `350px` to ensure even alignment of images.

The gallery should be responsive and look visually balanced across different screen sizes. Make sure to follow the specifications precisely to match the intended design.
